Odin Flight Booker

From The Odin Project(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms?ref=lnav)

"Project: Flight Booker

In this project, you’ll get a chance to tackle some more advanced forms. This is the kind of thing you’ll have to work with when handling user orders for anything more complicated than an e-book. "

In this project I had more practice with setting up models and associations, controller/view interaction, as well as work with nested forms.
